# Pomodoro-Clock-js-

This is a Pomodoro Timer I built for the Free Code Camp Frontend-Curriculum.
It is written in plain Javascript and a copy of the version on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/#) (with an audio-file added.)

## Usage
Just download the repository and open the **index.html** file. This will automatically start the countdown with a default time of 25min (session) and 5min (break). To change them once use the *reset* button and adjust the time with the *+* and *-* buttons. To change them permanently go into **index.js** file and change the *sTime* and *bTime* variables.
